# This script builds the Python Cloud Debugger agent from source code. The
# debugger is currently only supported on Linux.
#
# The build script assumes Python, cmake, curl and gcc are installed.
# To install these dependencies on Debian, run this commandd:
# sudo apt-get -y -q --no-install-recommends install \
#     curl ca-certificates gcc build-essential cmake \
#     python python-dev libpython2.7 python-setuptools
#
# The Python Cloud Debugger agent uses glog and gflags libraries. We build them
# first. Then we use setuptools to build the debugger agent. The entire
# build process is local and does not change any system directories.
#
# Home page of gflags: https://github.com/gflags/gflags
# Home page of glog: https://github.com/google/glog
